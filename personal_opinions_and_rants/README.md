# Personal Opinions & Rants (newest on _top_)

By Gabriel Staples  
Started 26 Apr. 2020

Sometimes I feel strongly about something and want to voice my opinion. Other times I feel frustrated and want to vent something. Until I get the time to get my new personal GitHub pages website (which I plan on using to replace [www.ElectricRCAircraftGuy.com](https://www.electricrcaircraftguy.com/) for professional content eventually as well) up and running and ready to go how I want it, I'm going to use this folder and readme as a location to voice my opinions, concerns, and rants, while having Stack Overflow remain a place for me to post my canonical answers and professional content (leaving the rants out). This way I can hopefully keep my Stack Overflow answers strictly helpful and more fact-based, or, where necessary, based on more well-thought-out and well-justified opinions. 

_Note the date format used below is (YYYYMMDD-HHMMhrs)._

# Rant #1 (20200426-1233hrs): MIN and MAX in C: my anti-overly-abstracted-C++ rant/aside

This is a rant that happened to accidentally make it into my Stack Overflow answer, and popped out as a Section 4 of that answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3437404/min-and-max-in-c/58532788#58532788.

Less than 24 hours later my upvotes on that question dropped from 4 to 3, so I can only assume it's because of this rant, as otherwise I believe my answer is actually a really good one, as I've put a ton of thought and effort into it and tried to be thorough enough that I can consider it a "canonical" answer on Max and Min, or, in other words, an answer I can confidently refer anyone to when they want an authoritative source with the full details.

So, I've moved my Section 4 rant out of that answer and to my opinions page here instead, so my real content can remain professional and factual. Here is my Section 4 rant. Enjoy:

(Added to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3437404/min-and-max-in-c/58532788#58532788 on 25 April 2020 (along with the new Section 3 I added at the same time), and removed from there on 26 Apr. 2020)

[RANT START]

## 4. Observation/lamentation on C vs C++ complexity:

Notice how my Section 2 is 4x longer than my section 1, and my Section 3 is 3x longer than my Section 2? That means my Section 3, for C++, is somewhere around ~12x longer than my Section 1. 

So it is with C++ vs C. C++ is MONSTROUSLY HUGE!--SO HUGE AND COMPLICATED IN FACT that I think it's pretty nuts sometimes. **I think people _should use C++ over C_**, but I certainly do not support the crazy abstractions I see so frequently used in C++ that you'd never see in C. It's becoming too much for one person to absorb. I speak English (native), Spanish (advanced), and French (conversational), and can read and write Arabic, and know a little Portuguese, _and C++ is like knowing English, Spanish, French, Italian, AND Portuguese, whereas C is like just knowing Spanish._ This is kind of nuts. Don't use all of C++ just because you can! Use the Spanish (C) and French (*****basic***** C++ classes) portions of C++ sure--they are great! Maybe even add in a little Italian (C++ templates) too, but the ridiculously complicated and monstrous way that I see C++ developers frequently code in **is like me speaking French to English friends and Spanish to my French friends just because I can**. It just creates garbage--that almost nobody can read. Seriously, it's lamentable. :(
