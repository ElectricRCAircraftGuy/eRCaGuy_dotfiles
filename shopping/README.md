#### Details

1. Saleae - the industry standard
    https://www.saleae.com/

    $500 \~ $1500:  
    https://usd.saleae.com/products/saleae-logic-pro-16  
    - Ex: 8-ch, 500 MHz, 10 G-sample buffer, $1000

    Windows, Mac, & Linux: https://www.saleae.com/downloads/

    On Amazon too; highly rated: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=saleae; one of the highest-rated products in the history of Amazon

    There are lots of lower-end $10 Saleae clones that people love too, but obviously they don't support Saleae :(. Ex: https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/va8but/comment/ic2fie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3; GS: clones are based on the original $100 Saleae I think, which is now discontinued, and the Cypress chip (FPGA, I think?)

    Summary:  
    - buy this professionally
    - hassle-free; it just works (one of their slogans, and it's true in my experience)
    - expensive

1. DreamSourceLab - Chinese; Kickstarted

    https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/

    Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreamsourcelab/dslogic-multifunction-instruments-for-everyone

    Much more economical. 

    $150 \~ $400:
    https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/product/dslogic-series/  
    - Ex: 32-ch, 1 GHz, 16 G-sample stream or 2 G-sample buffer, $400

    Windows, Mac, & Linux: https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/product/dslogic-series/  
    - **open-source** software!: https://github.com/DreamSourceLab/DSView 

    On Amazon too: https://amzn.to/3M3DwMt; not as highly-rated as Saleae; but still good, so I'm not too concerned about that. And, with highly-technical devices like this, some of the lower reviews may be user error, or not having the latest firmware or software (since it's open source). 

    Reviews:  
    1. Google search for "dsview saleae" - https://www.google.com/search?q=dsview+saleae&oq=dsview+saleae&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDI5MTVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
    1. https://hackaday.com/2015/05/26/review-dslogic-logic-analyzer/
        - Old review; written 2015 (DreamSourceLabs was kickstarted in 2013 it looks like)
        - "DSLogic designed by DreamSource Labs, can be thought of as an open source evolution of the original Saleae device."
    1. https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/is-saleae-logic-analyzer-still-worth-it-nowadays/
        - Nobody has used the DreamSourceLab one, but they don't have a problem with it. 
        - Replies #3 and 6 just talk about how much they love their Saleae. 
    1. https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/va8but/best_logic_analyzer_to_buy/
        - Software may be buggy: https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/va8but/comment/ic3iggr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
            - https://github.com/DreamSourceLab/DSView/issues/447
        - GS: again, that's the problem with open source software; this is an exchange of time vs money

    Summary:  
    - I have no problem with Chinese equipment; it is frequently fantastic quality and value
    - buy this for home or if you want to save money
    - open-source software, so it may require some tinkering and troubleshooting I suspect; https://github.com/DreamSourceLab/DSView; generous GPL V3.0 license
    - inexpensive / excellent value
