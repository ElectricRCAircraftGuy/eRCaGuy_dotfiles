# Gitignore File Formatting Notes:
# - add a / *after* a name to indicate a folder, and leave it off to indicate a file;
#   - example usage: `folder/`, `file`
# - Add a / *before* a name to indicate it is an absolute-style path starting at the "root" 
#   directory where this very .gitignore file is located; note this "root" directory is NOT 
#   necessarily this git repo's root directory where the ".git" folder is located, but rather, 
#   it is the directory where this .gitignore file is located;
#   - example usage: `/folder/`, `/file`
#   - See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43555850/git-gitignore-to-ignore-only-folder-in-root-directory/43555863#43555863
# - Use asterisks (*) for wildcards; ex: `/mydir/*/*.cpp`
# - Add an exclamation mark (!) *before* a path to indicate you do NOT want it ignored, even if 
#   it otherwise matches a path to ignore; example:
#   ```
#   /ignored_dir/*                          # ignore all **contents of** this dir
#   !/ignored_dir/special_file_to_include   # EXCEPT for this file--DO include it!
#   !/ignored_dir/special_dir_to_include/   # And EXCEPT for this dir--DO include it!
#   ```
#   Note, however, that if you've ignored a directory DIRECTLY, rather than merely its **contents**,
#   you canNOT UNignore anything in it! Therefore, you must change the ignore rule from ignoring the
#   directory to ignoring the **contents** of the directory! See here: 
#   https://stackoverflow.com/a/5285539/4561887
#   Example:
#   ```
#   # OK: we CAN use the `!` rule after this ignore to UNignore something inside the "ignored_dir":
#   /ignored_dir/*                          # ignore all **contents of** this dir
#   !/ignored_dir/special_file_to_include   # EXCEPT for this file--DO include it!
#
#   # **NOT** OK (UNignores inside the ignored dir will NOT work)!: we can NOT use the `!` rule 
#   after this ignore to UNignore something, as it simply won't work:
#   /ignored_dir/                           # ignore this dir itself (UNignores in this dir will NOT
#                                           # work now!)
#   !/ignored_dir/special_file_to_include   # Does NOT work! See above for the correct ignore style
#                                           # which _will_ allow subsequent UNignores!
#   ```
