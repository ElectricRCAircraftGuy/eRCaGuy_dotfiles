# INSTALLATION & USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
# - If you are using my bash configuration files for yourself, the primary file you
#   should edit and customize is the ".bash_aliases_private" file, NOT the ".bashrc" file.
# - See the "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/README.md" file, with full instructions and details, here:
#   https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/tree/master/home
#
# Option 1) (what you *may* want to use) if you think you will be editing your ~/.bashrc file
# directly, rather than the ~/.bash_aliases_private file like I recommend, then COPY this file
# to ~/.bashrc:
#   Option A) it doesn't exist in your home dir yet, so copy the whole thing over:
#           cp -i .bashrc ~
#   Option B) append the contents of this file to the end of your existing ~/.bashrc file:
#           cat .bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
# Option 2) (recommended, and what I do for most of my computers) if you plan to NOT edit your
# ~/.bashrc file directly, and instead edit only ~/.bash_aliases_private (like I do), then just
# SYMLINK this file from my repo into yoru home dir. This way you can pull my repo to always get
# the latest version of my ~/.bashrc file directly onto your computer too:
#       cd path/to/here
#       ln -si "${PWD}/.bashrc" ~
