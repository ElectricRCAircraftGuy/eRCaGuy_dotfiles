# This file is part of eRCaGuy_dotfiles: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles

# >> THIS IS THE PRIMARY BASH CONFIGURATION FILE FOR YOU TO EDIT AND CUSTOMIZE! <<

# INSTALLATION & USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. If you are pulling in my bash configuration files for your usage, I recommend you leave my
#    ".bashrc" and ".bash_aliases" files as-is, and edit and customize this
#    ".bash_aliases_private" file instead!
# 2. See the "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/README.md" file, with full instructions and details, here:
#    https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/tree/master/home

# Note: to remind yourself what the definition is for any given alias, just run
# `alias some_alias_name` at the terminal. To see all aliases, run just `alias`. To see
# ALL my custom aliases AND functions AND executable scripts, type `gs_` then press Tab Tab
# (Tab two times).

# ==================================================================================================
# PERSONAL (PRIVATE) Bash Setup, Variables, Aliases, & Functions
# - Add your personal, custom, or otherwise unshared bash aliases and functions here below.
# - It is recommended to use this file for your personal or private aliases and functions rather
#   than defining them in the "~/.bashrc" or "~/.bash_aliases" file.
# - If you have something you think is very useful to others, add it to the "~/.bash_aliases" file
#   and then open up a Pull Request on GitHub to ask me to merge it into the main eRCaGuy_dotfiles
#   repo.
# - All bash aliases or functions below will override any from the "~/.bash_aliases" file, prior
#   to the point this "~/.bash_aliases_private" file is sourced (imported), if they have the
#   same name.
# ==================================================================================================

# In my naming of aliases and functions, I like to precede names with my initials followed by an
# underscore, like this: `gs_some_cmd_name`. This way, simply by typing `gs_` at the terminal and
# then pressing Tab twice, I can quickly see a list of ALL of my available custom functions. To
# add your own initials, one technique is to simply add an alias to my aliases, like this. Let's
# assume your initials are "am":
#       alias am_open_default_tabs="gs_open_default_tabs"
#       alias am_alert="gs_alert"
#       # etc.

# Default terminal title:
# Uncomment one of the below options, or write your own, to set a default terminal title each time
# you open up a terminal. You can also change the current terminal title manually at any time. See
# `gs_set_title -h` for help.
#
# 1. Example static titles
# DEFAULT_TERMINAL_TITLE="my new title"
# 2. Example dynamic titles (must use single quotes around the whole title, as shown below)
# DEFAULT_TERMINAL_TITLE='Current Directory is "$PWD"'
# DEFAULT_TERMINAL_TITLE='Date and time of last cmd is "$(date)"'

# ------------- CONFIGURATION FOR `gs_open_default_tabs` Bash function (START) ---------------------
# You may configure up to 10 terminal tabs to be rapidly opened whenever you run
# `gs_open_default_tabs`. Each tab can be given a static or dynamic title, as well as a command to
# run when the tab is opened. If you need more than 10 you will need to edit the code for the
# function inside `.bash_aliases`.

# See my answer here for additional reference:
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/315408/open-terminal-with-multiple-tabs-and-execute-application/1026563#1026563

# Uncomment the line for your desired terminal.
TERMINAL="terminator"  # my preference since you can right-click and go to
                       # "Split Horizontally" or "Split Vertically"
# TERMINAL="gnome-terminal"  # the default that comes with Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, etc.

# Uncomment a tab title OR tab command below to configure this tab to open. You may configure
# just a title, just a command, or both.

# 1. Tab TITLES
TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_01='git'
TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_02='bazel'
TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_03='Python'
TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_04='ssh1'
TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_05='ssh2'
TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_06='ssh3'
TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_07='other'
# TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_08='other2'
# TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_09='dynamic title: last cmd time: "$(date)"'
# TERMINAL_TAB_TITLE_10='dynamic title (change your dir) "$(pwd)"'

# 2. Tab COMMANDS
# Notes:
#   1. You must use quotes, as shown in the examples below, around any paths with spaces in
#      the path.
#   2. Escape apostrophes in `echo -e` with `\x27`, as shown in the examples below. See also my
#      detailed answer here for more examples:
#      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1250079/how-to-escape-single-quotes-within-single-quoted-strings/65878993#65878993

# UPDATE THESE FOR YOU! See .bash_aliases for detailed notes.

# alias gs_ssh="ssh -X -o \"ServerAliveInterval 60\" username@domain_name"

# alias bazel_test_lldb='time bazel test --copt=-glldb --copt=-O0 --strip=never \
# //my/target1/... //my/target2/...; gs_alert'

# Get the size of your built executable or shared object (*.so file) and print it out.

# - Note that the `echo "$ ..."` parts of the command are just to remind you where these files are
#   located is all--as though you had just manually typed the `size` command at the command-line
#   instead of calling this alias. There is no magic there, and `$` means nothing special in this
#   case other than to make it look like a command you typed at the terminal.
# alias gs_program_size='\
# echo "$ size build/bin/path/to/my/executable1" && \
# size build/bin/path/to/my/executable1; \
# echo "$ size build/bin/path/to/my/executable2" && \
# size build/bin/path/to/my/executable2'
