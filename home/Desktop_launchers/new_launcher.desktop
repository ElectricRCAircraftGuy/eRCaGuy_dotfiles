# INSTRUCTIONS:
# See here for detailed desktop file installation instructions:
#   1. In this project: read "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/Desktop_launchers/README.md". 
#     - It shows various installation scripts available to "Install" and "Uninstall" custom .desktop files.
#       Here's how to use those scripts:
#       1. Ensure the following local directory exists:
#           mkdir -p ~/Desktop_launchers 
#       2. Make a copy of the desktop file you want. (Once copied, manually edit it as desired.):
#           cp -i eRCaGuy_dotfiles/Desktop_launchers/launcher_I_want.desktop ~/Desktop_launchers
#       3. "Install" this desktop file so it's accessible via the Application menu as well as on the Desktop:
#           eRCaGuy_dotfiles/Desktop_launchers/desktop_file_install.sh my_launcher.desktop
#       4. If you ever want to "Uninstall" this desktop file, simply run this:
#           eRCaGuy_dotfiles/Desktop_launchers/desktop_file_uninstall.sh my_launcher.desktop
#   2. Online: https://askubuntu.com/questions/64222/how-can-i-create-launchers-on-my-desktop/1014261#1014261
#
# Note: variables, such as $HOME, are NOT evaluated in standard .desktop file 'Exec' (Execution) & 'Icon' 
# paths, so use explicit, absolute paths, as shown below.
