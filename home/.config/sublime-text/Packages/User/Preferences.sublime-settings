// These are the Sublime Text 3 "user settings". They override all "default settings", but are
// overridden themselves by the "Syntax Specific" settings which are designed to only apply to
// files of a given type/extension. (Go to Preferences --> "Settings - Syntax Specific" to edit
// settings for just the file type/file extension type you currently have open now.)

// GENERAL SUBLIME TEXT USER SETTINGS:
// 1. ===> For Sublime Text general user settings help see here: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/settings.html <===
// 2. For Sublime Text Project Format settings help see here: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html
// 3. INSTRUCTIONS:
//    - Option A) Edit these settings as desired, then manually copy this file to
//        "/home/$USER/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings", OR
//    - Option B) Manually copy and paste the entire contents of this file into your Sublime Text 3 User preferences.
//        You can open your preferences in Sublime via Preferences --> Settings.
//    - Note that once you copy these settings to their proper place, Sublime will automatically remove all
//        comments and empty space to condense the settings into a single JSON block. This is expected behavior.

    // like to use 100 instead of 120, as it works on slightly older and lower-resolution displays
    // better, and also provides more room when looking at multiple columns of code at once on
    // modern displays. However, 120 is common too.
