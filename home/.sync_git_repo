# Variables for "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh" script

# The above script synchronizes a git repository from Personal Computer 1 (PC1) to Personal Computer 2 (PC2).

# INSTALLATION: 
# 1. Update the variables below with your information. 
# 2. Copy this file to ~/.sync_git_repo:
#       cp -i path/to/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/.sync_git_repo ~/.sync_git_repo
# 3. Ensure all your ssh keys are set up on both PC1 and PC2. This includes A) the keys to push/pull
#    to/from your remote git repos, and B) the keys required to ssh from PC1 into PC2.
# 4. Manually `git clone` your repo onto both PC1 and PC2.
# 5. Now run the sync script whenever you have changes you want to push from PC1 to PC2 for building or 
#    testing!: 
#       eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh

# The git repo root directory on PC2 where you are syncing your files TO; this dir must *already exist* 
# and you must have *already `git clone`d* a copy of your git repo into it!
# - Do NOT use variables such as `$HOME`. Be explicit instead. This is because the variable expansion will 
#   happen on the local machine when what we need is the variable expansion from the remote machine. Being 
#   explicit instead just avoids this problem.
PC2_GIT_REPO_TARGET_DIR="/home/gabriel/dev/eRCaGuy_dotfiles" # explicitly type this out; don't use variables

# Target SSH username: explicitly type this out; don't use variables; you may run any one of the following
# commands on your target machine to see your username:
#       who
#       whoami
#       echo $USER
#       echo $USERNAME
# Ex: "gabriel"
PC2_SSH_USERNAME="my_username"
# Target SSH hostname or IP address: explicitly type this out; don't use variables; run the `hostname` 
# command on your target machine to see your hostname, or run `ifconfig` to see your IP address.
# Ex: "gabriel-mypc1234", "10.0.0.100", or "192.168.200.100"
PC2_SSH_HOST="my_hostname"
