# Utilities and useful Bash functions:
#
# Put anything in here that you don't think needs to be in its own stand-alone file/program
# inside "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts", and which might fit better here than inside:
#
# 1. eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/.profile
# 1. eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/.bashrc
# 1. eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/.bash_aliases
# 1. eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/.bash_aliases_private
# 1. eRCaGuy_dotfiles/home/.git_aliases
#
# In other words, I'm thinking that small, general-purpose **utilities** and functions and things
# can go here. If the complexity becomes too much, consider moving them to their own file
# inside "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts" instead.

# Hex file utilities

# Function to convert .hex firmware files to .bin
# - Could be very useful for binary and hex file comparisons, too. See my answer here:
#   https://superuser.com/a/1790518/425838
#
# Example usage:
#
#       # this produces "path/to/myfile.bin" from "path/to/myfile.hex"
#       hex2bin path/to/myfile.hex
#
#       # you can pass multiple paths at once too
#       hex2bin path/to/myfile1.hex path/to/myfile2.hex path/to/myfile3.hex
#
hex2bin() {
    # treat all input args as file paths
    for filepath_hex in "$@"; do
        # See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/965072/4561887
        filepath_hex_no_extension="${filepath_hex%.*}"
        filepath_bin="${filepath_hex_no_extension}.bin"
        # debugging
        # echo "filepath_hex_no_extension = $filepath_hex_no_extension"
        # echo "filepath_bin = $filepath_bin"
        echo "Converting \"$filepath_hex\" to \"$filepath_bin\"."

        xc32-objcopy --input-target=ihex --output-target=binary \
            "$filepath_hex" "$filepath_bin"
    done
}

# underscore and hitting Tab Tab.

# Function to convert .hex firmware files to .bin and then to a
# human-compare-friendly .xxd.hex, so you can easily compare two files with
# `diff` or `meld`.
