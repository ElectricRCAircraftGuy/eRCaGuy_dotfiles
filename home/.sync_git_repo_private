# This file is part of eRCaGuy_dotfiles: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles

# This file contains custom, private variables and ssh information for you to run the
# "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh" script.

# The above script synchronizes a git repository from Personal Computer 1 (PC1) to Personal Computer
# 2 (PC2).

# INSTALLATION:
# See the instructions in "eRCaGuy_dotfiles/useful_scripts/sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2.sh", as
# well as in the associated README that is mentioned there.

# DESCRIPTIONS:
#
# MY_NAME
#       Your name. No spaces allowed! Recommended to use all lower-case. This is only used to help
#       create the synchronization git branch name.
#
# TARGET
#       A target name to specify which "PC2" you'd like to synchronize your "PC1" to. You will be
#       able to call this target name directly when you call the script, so make it something you
#       can easily remember. Here is an example call to the script with the target name "desktop"
#       passed as an argument: `gs_sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2 desktop`.
#
# PC2_USERNAME
#       The target PC (PC2) SSH username. Explicitly type this out. Do not use variables, as they
#       won't expand as expected since they will expand on your local computer and not on your
#       target computer. You may run any one of the following commands on your target machine to see
#       your username:
#               who
#               whoami
#               echo $USER
#               echo $USERNAME
#       Example username: "gabriel"
#
# PC2_HOSTNAME
#       The target PC (PC2) SSH hostname or IP address. Explicitly type this out. Do not use
#       variables, as they won't expand as expected since they will expand on your local computer
#       and not on your target computer. Run the `hostname` command on your target machine to see
#       your hostname, or run `ifconfig` to see your IP address.
#       Example hostnames: "gabriel-mypc1234", "10.0.0.100", or "192.168.200.100"
#
# PC2_TARGETDIR
#       Target directory: the git repo root directory on PC2 where you are syncing your files TO.
#       This directory must **already exist** and you must have **already `git clone`d** a copy of
#       your git repo into it! Do NOT use variables such as `$HOME`. Be explicit instead. This is
#       because the variable expansion will happen on the local machine when what we need is the
#       variable expansion from the remote machine. Example git repo target directory:
#       "/home/gabriel/dev/eRCaGuy_dotfiles"
#
# PC2_SYNCBRANCH
#       Synchronization branch name: this is the name of the remote git branch we will push to on
#       PC1, and pull from on PC2, for the file synchronization to take place from PC1 to PC2. You
#       can set it to anything you want. If you leave it as-is below it will auto-generate a
#       synchronization branch name using the variables above it.
#       Example remote synchronization branch name: "john.smith_SYNC_desktop".
#
# DEFAULT_TARGET
#       Set a default target to be automatically used whenever you call the script withOUT
#       specifying the target explicitly. In other words, this is the target used whenever you call
#       the script name only, like this: `gs_sync_git_repo_from_pc1_to_pc2`. Be sure to use one of
#       the target names of the targets already defined above it.
