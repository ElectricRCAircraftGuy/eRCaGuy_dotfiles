# DESCRIPTION:
# imwheel configuration settings to speed up the scroll speed for these applications, as a
# multiplier by the numerical integer value at the end of the first two rows of each block.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# NB: `imwheel` only works fully in the X11 Window manager! In the Wayland window manager, it only
# works in a very small set of programs which use XWayland (whatever that is), such as Chrome! To
# get full functionality, you will need to switch back to the X11 window manager, as I explain
# here: https://askubuntu.com/a/1470563/327339.
#
# 1. Install imwheel:
#       sudo apt update
#       sudo apt install imwheel
# 2. Read & follow the instructions at the link below. Edit the two numbers at the top-right of each
# configuration block below to set the mouse scroll speed.
#	(PREFERRED) Symlink the file into the home dir:
#		cd path/to/here
#		ln -si "${PWD}/.imwheelrc" ~
#	OR, copy this file to ~/.imwheelrc so you can edit it without affecting
#   this repo:
#       cp -i .imwheelrc ~

# Note: to get an idea for what name to use for each application, as specified at the top of each
# configuration block below, open the application of interest to get its process(es) running, then
# search for its name among all running processes like this:
#       ps aux | grep 'application_name'
#
# The above `ps` method may only work **sometimes!**. Even better: look at the .desktop shortcut
# file for a given application, to see what the name of the executable is. Ex:
# `cat /usr/share/applications/microsoft-edge.desktop | grep 'Exec'` will reveal the name of the
# executable for the Microsoft Edge browser! As shown below, you can see that its executable name
# is `microsoft-edge-stable`, located at path `/usr/bin/microsoft-edge-stable`:
#
#       $ cat /usr/share/applications/microsoft-edge.desktop | grep 'Exec'
#       Exec=/usr/bin/microsoft-edge-stable %U
#       Exec=/usr/bin/microsoft-edge-stable
#       Exec=/usr/bin/microsoft-edge-stable --inprivate

# NB: for the `micro` CLI-mouse-enabled text editor, don't use imwheel. Instead,
# set the scroll speed inside micro directly with Ctrl + E, then the cmd: `set
# scrollspeed 5`. That adds a `"scrollspeed": 5,` entry to
# `~/.config/micro/settings.json`.
#
# See:
# 1. My answer/notes:
#    https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/issues/2134#issuecomment-1404047315
#
# That scroll speed of 5, in conjunction with a terminator scroll speed of 2,
# above, for instance, results in a total scroll speed in `micro` of 5 x 2 = 10.
