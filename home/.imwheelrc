# DESCRIPTION:
# imwheel configuration settings to speed up the scroll speed for these applications, as a
# multiplier by the numerical integer value at the end of the first two rows of each block.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Install imwheel:
#       sudo apt update
#       sudo apt install imwheel
# 2. Read & follow the instructions at the link below. Edit the two numbers at the top-right of each
# configuration block below to set the mouse scroll speed. 
#	(PREFERRED) Symlink the file into the home dir:
#		cd path/to/here
#		ln -si "${PWD}/.imwheelrc" ~
#	OR, copy this file to ~/.imwheelrc so you can edit it without affecting 
#   this repo:
#       cp -i .imwheelrc ~

# Note: to get an idea for what name to use for each application, as specified at the top of each
# configuration block below, open the application of interest to get its process(es) running, then
# search for its name among all running processes like this:
#       ps aux | grep 'application_name'

# NB: for the `micro` CLI-mouse-enabled text editor, don't use imwheel. Instead,
# set the scroll speed inside micro directly with Ctrl + E, then the cmd: `set
# scrollspeed 5`. That adds a `"scrollspeed": 5,` entry to
# `~/.config/micro/settings.json`.
#
# See:
# 1. My answer/notes:
#    https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/issues/2134#issuecomment-1404047315
#
# That scroll speed of 5, in conjunction with a terminator scroll speed of 2,
# above, for instance, results in a total scroll speed in `micro` of 5 x 2 = 10.
