# eRCaGuy_dotfiles/Diagrams

I will put links to Google Docs drawings and other UML or UML-like diagrams I make here. **You can copy and paste them to use them as templates.** They are useful for design reviews, software write-ups and design documents, describing program flow, etc.

<a id="instructions-for-use"></a>
## Instructions for use
To copy and paste one of my drawings as a starting point for your own _inside of a Google Doc_, do the following:

1. Click the Google Doc link for the diagram you want below, to open up the Google Doc containing that drawing.
1. In the Google Doc that opens, right-click the diagram of interest and go to `Copy` (you can also left-click on the diagram and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy, but sometimes I find that to be glitchy and not work as well).
1. In the Google Doc you'd like to paste this drawing/diagram into, right-click and go to `Paste`, _or_ press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste. This embeds the drawing into your Google Doc. 
1. Double-left-click the drawing in your Google Doc to open and edit it. It looks like this, for example: 
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6842199/159632049-e5c8899b-069b-49b8-a251-d91f625f8ee6.png)
1. If you'd like to export it as an image: with the drawing open in edit mode, click the `Actions` button in the top-left and go to `Download` --> choose whatever format you want; ex: `JPEG image (.jpg)`. You can also choose PDF, PNG, or SVG formats. See the image above. 
1. Click "Save and Close" in the top-right of the drawing editor when done editing the drawing.

## Tips, Limitations/Weird Behaviors, and Work-arounds
1. Use the below diagrams on Google Drive in Google Docs or in Google Drawings as templates and starting points for your own designs. 
1. To insert a brand new drawing inside of a Google Doc, go to `Insert` --> `Drawing` --> `New`.
    1. **IMPORTANT QUIRK/BUG:** the _size_ of the drawing canvas when inserting a drawing inside of a Google Doc like this is NOT editable nor configurable. Furthermore, _the canvas size will dynamically vary at the moment you insert the new drawing according to your current browser **window size** and **screen resolution**._ So, on a low-resolution monitor the drawing canvas might be only 6x5 inches. On a large 32" 4K monitor such as my own (see [my full desktop setup here](https://gabrielstaples.com/work-from-home-work-station/)), however, it will be greater than 13x9 inches, as you can see in the image above. 
    1. So, to ensure you get the larger canvas size like I have, either drag your browser window onto your largest monitor and maximize the window before inserting a new drawing, OR just copy/paste one of my own drawings into your Google Doc as a starting point.
1. To use my drawings as a starting point, copy/paste them from my Google Doc into your Google Doc as described in the "Instructions for use" section above.
1. To open and edit an existing drawing inside of a Google Doc, just double-left-click it.
1. To export an embedded drawing as an image or PDF, open it for editing it and then click the `Actions` button in the top-left of the drawing editor and go to `Download`.
1. Shapes such as rectangles in Google Drawings only have 4 connection points to connect arrows to: on the top, bottom, left, and right of the shape. This isn't enough. To add more connector points to a shape, see my answer here where I describe a hack I use in my diagrams below: [Web Applications: Can I add custom connectors on Google Drawings shapes?](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/163632/126659). 
1. Use **<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>** to _Duplicate_ a shape in your drawing, such as a method-call box. This is faster than pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy a shape and then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste a copy of it.
