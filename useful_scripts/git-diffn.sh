# Status: IT WORKS! USE AS A COMPLETE, 100% SYNTAX-COMPATIBLE, DROP-IN REPLACEMENT FOR `git diff`!
#         See details just below.

# Author: Gabriel Staples
# www.ElectricRCAircraftGuy.com 

# DESCRIPTION:
# git-diffn.sh
# - a drop-in replacement for `git diff` which also shows line 'n'umbers! Use it *exactly* like
#   `git diff`, except you'll see these beautiful line numbers as well to help you make sense of
#   your changes. 
# - since it's just a light-weight awk-language-based wrapper around `git diff`, it accepts ALL 
#   options and parameters that `git diff` accepts. Examples:
#   - `git diffn HEAD~`
#   - `git diffn HEAD~3..HEAD~2`
# - works with any of your `git diff` color settings, even if you are using custom colors
#   - See my answer here for how to set custom diff colors, as well as to see a screenshot of
#     custom-color output from `git diffn`:
#     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26941144/how-do-you-customize-the-color-of-the-diff-header-in-git-diff/61993060#61993060
#   - Here are some sample `git config` commands from my answer above to set custom `git diff` 
#     colors and attributes (text formatting):
#           git config --global color.diff.meta "blue"
#           git config --global color.diff.old "black red strike"
#           git config --global color.diff.new "black green italic"
#           git config --global color.diff.context "yellow bold"
# - in `git diffn`, color output is ON by default; if you want to disable the output color, you 
#   must use `--no-color` or `--color=never`. See `man git diff` for details. Examples: 
#   - `git diffn --color=never HEAD~`
#   - `git diffn --no-color HEAD~3..HEAD~2`

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Create a symlink in ~/bin to this script so you can run it from anywhere as `git diffn` OR
#    as `git-diffn` OR as `gs_git-diffn` OR as `git gs_diffn`. Note that "gs" is my initials. 
#    I do these versions with "gs_" in them so I can find all scripts I've written really easily 
#    by simply typing "gs_" + Tab + Tab, or "git gs_" + Tab + Tab. 
#       cd /path/to/here
#       mkdir -p ~/bin
#       ln -si "${PWD}/git-diffn.sh" ~/bin/git-diffn     # required
#       ln -si "${PWD}/git-diffn.sh" ~/bin/git-gs_diffn  # optional; replace "gs" with your initials
#       ln -si "${PWD}/git-diffn.sh" ~/bin/gs_git-diffn  # optional; replace "gs" with your initials
# 2. Now you can use this command directly anywhere you like in any of these 5 ways:
#   1. `git diffn`  <=== my preferred way to use this program, so it feels just like `git diff`!
#   2. `git-diffn`
#   3. `git gs_diffn`
#   4. `git-gs_diffn`
#   3. `gs_git-diffn`

# FUTURE WORK:
# 1. Make work with standard awk?
#    This has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04. If anyone can't get this working on their system,
#    such as in the git bash terminal that comes with Git for Windows, or on MacOS, due to 
#    compatibility probems with `gawk`, I can rewrite the few places relying on `gawk` extensions
#    to just use basic awk instead. That should solve any compatibility problems, but there's no
#    sense in doing it if there's no need. If I ever need to do this in the future though, I'm
#    going to need this trick to obtain a substring using standard awk:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5536018/how-to-print-matched-regex-pattern-using-awk/5536342#5536342
#   1. Also, look into this option in gawk for testing said compatibility: 
#     1. `--lint` - https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Options.html
#     1. `--traditional` and `--posix` - https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Compatibility-Mode.html
#   1. Currently, `--lint` is telling me that the 3rd argument to `match()` (ie: the array 
#      parameter) is a gawk extension.

# Awk-language Notes:
# The gist of awk: pattern {action}
#  - See here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK
# Meaning of tidle (~): "matches a regular expression against a string" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK)
#  - Can be read as: "check the operands on either side to see if they match" (http://billconner.com/techie/awk.html)
#  - See also here: https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html#uh-11
#  - Ex:  `my_var ~ /regex/ { action }` means: "if the contents of my_var has a match against 
#    the regular expression "regex", then do `action`".

# IMPORTANT: SINCE I'M USING SINGLE QUOTES (' ') AROUND THE WHOLE AWK PROGRAM BELOW, ***NO***
# UNESCAPED SINGLE QUOTES ARE ALLOWED IN THE CODE BELOW, ***INCLUDING IN AWK COMMENTS!*** Since 
# this comment says "I'm" in it, if you move it down into the awk code below, it will make the awk
# code fail to run too!

# ANSI Color Code Examples to help make sense of the regex expressions below
# Git config color code descriptions; see here:

# Use this website to help you decipher and build regular expressions: https://regex101.com/

# A regex expression to match any of the "single code" (text color only) color codes above, 
# including `1m` through `99m`, is as follows:
#       ^(\033\[[0-9]{1,2}m)?

# Now, expanding upon that, here's a regexp which can handle "multiple code" (text color (x1) +
# background color (x1) + attributes (0 or more)) color codes, with 1 to 10 groups of "1;", "30;",
# "41", "42", etc. codes is this:
#       ^(\033\[(([0-9]{1,2};?){1,10})m)?

# Be sure to place all args (`"$@"`) AFTER `--color=always` so that if the user passes in
# `--color=never` or `--no-color` they will override my `--color=always` here, since later
# options override earlier ones.
